      oneLiner: "Congress blocks DC's proven traffic safety measures (cameras cut fatal crashes 30%) while DC has one of the highest pedestrian death rates in the nation.",

      elevatorPitch: "DC residents voted for traffic safety cameras that reduce speeding by 70% and fatal crashes by 30% near schools. House Republicans blocked funding for these cameras, calling them 'tyranny'—while DC has one of the highest pedestrian fatality rates among major cities. Congress prioritizes convenience for drivers passing through over DC residents' lives.",

      fullArgument: "Washington DC has one of the highest pedestrian fatality rates among major U.S. cities, yet Congress actively blocks the city from implementing proven safety measures. Automated traffic cameras reduce speeding by 70% and cut fatal crashes by 30% near schools, according to traffic safety data. Despite this evidence, House Republicans held multiple hearings in 2023-2024 specifically targeting DC's traffic cameras and right-on-red ban, with one congressman calling automated enforcement 'tyranny.' The 2025 appropriations bill included riders blocking funding for these life-saving cameras. Congress is micromanaging DC's local traffic policy to protect drivers passing through from other states, prioritizing their convenience over the lives of DC residents—including children walking to school. No state faces this level of federal interference in local traffic enforcement."

    persuadable: {
      oneLiner: "Congress blocks DC from using traffic cameras to protect kids near schools—cameras that reduce fatal crashes 30% and are used in dozens of states nationwide.",

      elevatorPitch: "Traffic cameras near DC schools reduce fatal crashes by 30% and speeding by 70%—proven, data-driven safety measures used across America. Yet Congress blocked DC from funding these cameras while DC's pedestrian death rate remains among the worst in the nation. This isn't about politics—it's about preventing children from being killed walking to school. Local communities should decide their own traffic safety policies.",

      fullArgument: "Automated traffic enforcement is a proven, data-driven safety tool used by communities across America, from red states to blue states. The evidence is clear: traffic cameras reduce speeding by 70% and cut fatal crashes by 30% near schools, protecting children and families. Washington DC, which has one of the highest pedestrian fatality rates among major cities, implemented these cameras to save lives. Yet Congress has blocked DC from funding this local safety program—a level of federal micromanagement that no state endures. Conservative principles support local control and evidence-based policy. If a Texas town wants traffic cameras near schools to protect kids, the federal government shouldn't interfere. The same principle applies to DC. This isn't about red or blue politics—it's about preventing preventable deaths and respecting local decision-making. DC taxpayers fund their own traffic enforcement, and they should be free to use proven tools to protect their families."
