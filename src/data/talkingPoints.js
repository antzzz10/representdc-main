      oneLiner: "House Republicans are literally micromanaging DC's traffic lights while 700,000 residents have no vote in Congress—blocking proven safety measures that save children's lives.",

      elevatorPitch: "House Republicans held hearings to block DC's traffic cameras and right-on-red ban, with one congressman calling safety enforcement 'tyranny.' Meanwhile, DC has one of the worst pedestrian death rates in America. This is what taxation without representation looks like: suburban drivers' convenience matters more than DC kids walking to school. No state would tolerate Congress micromanaging their stop signs.",

      fullArgument: "This is authoritarian control, plain and simple. House Republicans are micromanaging DC's traffic lights, speed cameras, and crosswalk rules while 700,000 DC residents have zero voting representation in Congress. They held multiple hearings in 2023-2024 specifically targeting DC's traffic safety measures—cameras that [reduce fatal crashes by 30%](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/study-red-light-cameras-cut-fatal-crashes) and [speeding by 70%](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/vision-zero-initiative) near schools. One congressman called automated enforcement 'tyranny' and the 2025 appropriations bill blocked funding for these life-saving cameras. DC has [one of the highest pedestrian fatality rates](https://www.ghsa.org/resources/Pedestrians24) among major cities, yet Congress prioritizes the convenience of drivers passing through from Virginia and Maryland over DC children's lives. This is taxation without representation in its most literal form: Congress treating DC like federal property instead of a home to 700,000 Americans who [pay more federal taxes per capita](https://www.dcfpi.org/all/federal-taxes-paid-by-district-residents/) than any state. No state—red or blue—would tolerate this level of federal interference in their local traffic enforcement. We need statehood now."

      oneLiner: "Federal politicians are micromanaging DC's traffic policy—blocking evidence-based safety tools (30% crash reduction) funded entirely by local taxpayers, not federal dollars.",

      elevatorPitch: "Traffic cameras near schools reduce fatal crashes 30% and are used in communities nationwide, red states and blue. Yet federal politicians blocked DC from funding its own traffic safety program—zero federal money involved, 100% local taxpayer dollars. If your town council voted for speed cameras to protect kids, should Washington politicians override that decision? This is federal overreach that violates the conservative principle of local control.",

      fullArgument: "Evidence-based traffic enforcement works: cameras [reduce speeding by 70%](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/vision-zero-initiative) and [cut fatal crashes by 30%](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/study-red-light-cameras-cut-fatal-crashes) near schools. Communities across America—from Arizona to Ohio to Texas—use automated enforcement as a proven safety tool. Washington DC implemented cameras to address [one of the nation's highest pedestrian fatality rates](https://www.ghsa.org/resources/Pedestrians24). Here's what happened: Congress blocked DC from spending its own locally-raised tax dollars on this program. Not federal funds—DC taxpayer money that DC residents voted to spend on protecting their own children. Apply the conservative principle consistently: if a Texas town council votes for traffic cameras near schools, should federal politicians in Washington override that local decision? That's not federalism, that's federal micromanagement. DC funds its entire traffic enforcement program with local dollars, generating [zero cost to the federal budget](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/automated-traffic-enforcement). The same states' rights principle that protects your community's local decisions should apply to DC. This is about preventing preventable deaths through evidence-based policy and respecting local control—not red or blue politics."

      oneLiner: "For 37 years, Congress has blocked DC from using its own local tax dollars for abortion services—a restriction no state faces—while overriding DC laws protecting reproductive healthcare and gender-affirming care.",

      elevatorPitch: "Since 1988, the Dornan Amendment has banned DC from spending even its own locally-raised tax revenue on abortion services for low-income residents. In 2011, Congress nearly shut down DC's government over abortion funding. Now Congress is trying to repeal DC's shield law protecting abortion and gender-affirming care providers while 22 states have identical protections. This is taxation without representation: DC residents pay federal taxes but can't make their own healthcare decisions.",

      fullArgument: "This is authoritarian control over the most personal healthcare decisions. Since 1988, Congress has renewed the Dornan Amendment annually, blocking DC from using any funds—even locally-raised tax revenue—for abortion services. No state faces this restriction. In 2011, [Congress nearly forced a government shutdown](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/congress-dc-abortion-funding-fight/2011/04/08/) because DC's budget included local abortion funding. House Republicans have also blocked DC's [death with dignity laws](https://dcist.com/story/17/01/23/congress-blocks-dc-death-with-dignity-law/), needle exchange programs, and medical marijuana regulations. Now Rep. Christopher Smith (R-NJ) and others are pushing to repeal DC's [Human Rights Sanctuary Amendment Act](https://code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/laws/24-257)—a shield law protecting abortion and gender-affirming care providers from out-of-state investigations. Twenty-two states have identical shield law protections, yet Congress singles out DC for interference. This creates a two-tiered system where constitutional rights depend on your zip code. DC residents [pay more federal taxes per capita](https://www.dcfpi.org/all/federal-taxes-paid-by-district-residents/) than any state but can't make basic healthcare decisions with their own money. No state would tolerate this level of federal control over local healthcare policy. We need statehood now."

      elevatorPitch: "Since 1988, federal law has banned DC from spending even locally-raised tax revenue (zero federal dollars) on abortion services—a restriction no state faces. Congress has also blocked DC's death with dignity law and other local healthcare decisions. Twenty-two states have shield laws protecting healthcare providers, but Congress is trying to repeal DC's identical law. If Texas passed a shield law for healthcare providers, should Washington override it? This is federal micromanagement of local healthcare decisions funded entirely by local taxpayers.",

      fullArgument: "Local communities should control healthcare policy funded with their own tax dollars. Since 1988, Congress has annually renewed the Dornan Amendment, blocking DC from spending locally-raised revenue (not federal funds) on abortion services. No state faces this restriction—it's unique to DC. Apply the conservative principle consistently: if your state legislature voted to fund certain healthcare services with state tax dollars, should federal politicians override that decision? Beyond abortion, Congress has blocked DC's [death with dignity law](https://dcist.com/story/17/01/23/congress-blocks-dc-death-with-dignity-law/)—supported by DC voters—and interfered with needle exchange programs and medical marijuana regulations. Now Congress is targeting DC's shield law, which protects healthcare providers from out-of-state investigations. [Twenty-two states have identical shield law protections](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/shield-laws-sexual-and-reproductive-health-care) for reproductive and gender-affirming care—including red states protecting their providers' ability to serve out-of-state patients. Yet Congress is trying to repeal DC's law while leaving state laws untouched. This isn't about red or blue politics—it's about whether local communities can make healthcare decisions with their own money. DC taxpayers [pay more per capita to the federal government](https://www.dcfpi.org/all/federal-taxes-paid-by-district-residents/) than any state, yet face restrictions no state tolerates. The same federalism principle that protects your state's healthcare decisions should apply to DC."

Yet [New Jersey's Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act](https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2022/approved/20220113a.shtml) enshrined abortion rights as fundamental in 2022, [expanded contraceptive coverage from 6 to 12 months](https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/01/13/murphy-signs-law-solidifying-abortion-rights-in-new-jersey/), and is studying whether to require insurance coverage of abortion costs.

      oneLiner: "Congress overruled DC voters to ban non-citizen residents (green card holders, taxpayers) from voting in local elections—while 18 cities in other states have the same policy and Congress doesn't interfere.",

      elevatorPitch: "In 2022, DC voters approved allowing non-citizen residents—green card holders who pay local taxes—to vote in local elections for mayor and city council. H.R. 884 would repeal that law. Meanwhile, 18 cities in California, Maryland, and Vermont allow noncitizen voting in local elections, and Congress doesn't try to override them. House Republicans also introduced a bill blocking DC from using ranked choice voting, even though New York City, Salt Lake City, and 45 other cities use it. This is taxation without representation: Congress claims absolute power over who can vote in DC's local elections while those same DC voters have zero representation in Congress itself.",

      fullArgument: "This is a circular disenfranchisement unique in American democracy. In 2022, DC passed the [Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act](https://dccouncil.gov/dc-local-resident-voting-rights-amendment-act-of-2022/), allowing non-citizen residents who meet residency requirements—green card holders who pay DC taxes—to vote in local elections for mayor, city council, and school board. Not federal elections, just local decisions affecting their own community. H.R. 884, sponsored by Rep. August Pfluger (R-TX), passed the House in June 2025 and would repeal this law. Here's the hypocrisy: [18 municipalities in California, Maryland, and Vermont](https://ballotpedia.org/Laws_permitting_noncitizens_to_vote_in_the_United_States) allow noncitizen voting in local elections—including cities that have had these policies since the 1990s. Congress doesn't try to override any of them. Only DC faces federal interference. Beyond noncitizen voting, Rep. Michael Lawler (R-NY) introduced H.R. 2562 to block DC from using [ranked choice voting](https://www.rcvresources.org/where-is-rcv-used/)—despite his home state's largest city, New York City, using RCV for local elections since 2021 (approved by 73.6% of NYC voters). Forty-seven US cities use ranked choice voting, including Salt Lake City, Seattle, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Congress doesn't block any of them. Congress claims the power to decide who can vote in DC's local elections and what voting methods DC can use—while denying DC residents voting representation in that same Congress. No state would tolerate federal politicians overriding local voter eligibility and election procedures. We need statehood now."
