      oneLiner: "House Republicans are literally micromanaging DC's traffic lights while 700,000 residents have no vote in Congress—blocking proven safety measures that save children's lives.",

      elevatorPitch: "House Republicans held hearings to block DC's traffic cameras and right-on-red ban, with one congressman calling safety enforcement 'tyranny.' Meanwhile, DC has one of the worst pedestrian death rates in America. This is what taxation without representation looks like: suburban drivers' convenience matters more than DC kids walking to school. No state would tolerate Congress micromanaging their stop signs.",

      fullArgument: "This is authoritarian control, plain and simple. House Republicans are micromanaging DC's traffic lights, speed cameras, and crosswalk rules while 700,000 DC residents have zero voting representation in Congress. They held multiple hearings in 2023-2024 specifically targeting DC's traffic safety measures—cameras that [reduce fatal crashes by 30%](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/study-red-light-cameras-cut-fatal-crashes) and [speeding by 70%](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/vision-zero-initiative) near schools. One congressman called automated enforcement 'tyranny' and the 2025 appropriations bill blocked funding for these life-saving cameras. DC has [one of the highest pedestrian fatality rates](https://www.ghsa.org/resources/Pedestrians24) among major cities, yet Congress prioritizes the convenience of drivers passing through from Virginia and Maryland over DC children's lives. This is taxation without representation in its most literal form: Congress treating DC like federal property instead of a home to 700,000 Americans who [pay more federal taxes per capita](https://www.dcfpi.org/all/federal-taxes-paid-by-district-residents/) than any state. No state—red or blue—would tolerate this level of federal interference in their local traffic enforcement. We need statehood now."

    persuadable: {
      oneLiner: "Federal politicians are micromanaging DC's traffic policy—blocking evidence-based safety tools (30% crash reduction) funded entirely by local taxpayers, not federal dollars.",

      elevatorPitch: "Traffic cameras near schools reduce fatal crashes 30% and are used in communities nationwide, red states and blue. Yet federal politicians blocked DC from funding its own traffic safety program—zero federal money involved, 100% local taxpayer dollars. If your town council voted for speed cameras to protect kids, should Washington politicians override that decision? This is federal overreach that violates the conservative principle of local control.",

      fullArgument: "Evidence-based traffic enforcement works: cameras [reduce speeding by 70%](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/vision-zero-initiative) and [cut fatal crashes by 30%](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/study-red-light-cameras-cut-fatal-crashes) near schools. Communities across America—from Arizona to Ohio to Texas—use automated enforcement as a proven safety tool. Washington DC implemented cameras to address [one of the nation's highest pedestrian fatality rates](https://www.ghsa.org/resources/Pedestrians24). Here's what happened: Congress blocked DC from spending its own locally-raised tax dollars on this program. Not federal funds—DC taxpayer money that DC residents voted to spend on protecting their own children. Apply the conservative principle consistently: if a Texas town council votes for traffic cameras near schools, should federal politicians in Washington override that local decision? That's not federalism, that's federal micromanagement. DC funds its entire traffic enforcement program with local dollars, generating [zero cost to the federal budget](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/automated-traffic-enforcement). The same states' rights principle that protects your community's local decisions should apply to DC. This is about preventing preventable deaths through evidence-based policy and respecting local control—not red or blue politics."

        point: "Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) introduced three bills blocking DC's traffic cameras—yet Pennsylvania law allows red light cameras, and Philadelphia has 34 intersections with cameras (with 71 more planned)",
        examples: "Perry sponsors H.R. 5525 (Stop DC CAMERA Act) and amendments to H.R. 5242 blocking DC camera funding. Meanwhile, [Pennsylvania permits municipalities to use red light cameras](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/03/traffic-camera-bill-traffic-philadelphia-safety-legislature/), and [Philadelphia operates 34 camera intersections](https://philapark.org/red-light-cameras/) with plans for 71 more. Pittsburgh, Abington Township, Montgomery Township, Bensalem Township, and Warrington Township also use automated enforcement."

      {
        point: "Pennsylvania saw pedestrian deaths increase in 2023 (192 deaths, up from 184 in 2022) while most states saw decreases—yet Perry blocks DC's proven safety measures",
        examples: "[Pennsylvania drivers killed 192 pedestrians in 2023](https://www.thecentersquare.com/pennsylvania/article_3274cee0-358d-11ef-8ba4-03448e933927.html), an increase from 2022, making Pennsylvania one of only 21 states where pedestrian deaths rose. Meanwhile, Perry's bills prevent DC from using the same automated enforcement tools that [Pennsylvania cities rely on](https://www.photoenforced.com/pennsylvania.html) to improve safety."
