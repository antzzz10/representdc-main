# Criminal Justice Reform - Talking Points Draft

**For review before adding to talkingPoints.js**

## Allies

### One-Liner
"In 2023, Congress overturned DC's entire revised criminal code—16 years of work by judges and prosecutors—while DC has the highest incarceration rate in the nation and no vote in Congress to defend local reforms."

### Elevator Pitch
"In 2023, Congress used a rare disapproval resolution to overturn DC's revised criminal code—the culmination of 16 years of work by judges, prosecutors, and community advocates. It was only the second time in 50 years Congress fully blocked a DC law. Now Congress is targeting DC's police accountability measures and bail reform while states across the country adopt similar policies. DC has the highest incarceration rate in the nation, yet Congress blocks every effort at criminal justice reform. This is taxation without representation: DC residents pay federal taxes but can't enact the criminal justice policies their elected officials support."

### Full Argument
"This is authoritarian control over the most fundamental issues of public safety and justice. In 2023, Congress passed H.J.Res. 26 to overturn DC's [Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/26)—a comprehensive modernization that was 16 years in the making, involved judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and community advocates, and passed the DC Council unanimously. The Senate voted 81-14 to block it, marking [only the second time in 50 years](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/08/1161902691/d-c-crime-bill-biden-overturn) Congress fully overturned a DC law and the first time the Senate voted to do so. President Biden signed the disapproval resolution despite previously opposing congressional interference in DC affairs.

The pattern continues in 2025. H.R. 5107, the [CLEAN DC Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/5107), passed the House (233-190) to repeal DC's Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022—which established common-sense police accountability measures like requiring officers to consult mental health workers before using deadly force and prohibiting officers from reviewing body camera footage before writing initial incident reports. These are policies that [20 states have mandated for body cameras](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/body-camera-laws-by-state), including Georgia, whose congressman Andrew Clyde sponsors H.R. 5107.

H.R. 5214, the [District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/5214), passed the House (237-179) to force DC to reinstate cash bail—overriding DC's pretrial justice reforms. Yet [Illinois eliminated cash bail entirely](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/no-cash-bail-states) in 2023 through the Pretrial Fairness Act, New Jersey virtually eliminated it in 2017, and New York ended it for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies in 2020. Congress doesn't try to override any state's bail reform policies—only DC's.

Here's the context: DC has [the highest incarceration rate in the United States](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/DC.html)—816 per 100,000 people, higher than Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. DC's jail population is [87.4% Black](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/mcrp-journal/blog/true-justice-the-disturbing-truth-about-incarceration-in-d-c/) despite Black residents comprising 44.4% of DC's population. This disparity is driven partly by decades of congressional interventions that override local preferences for reform and restorative justice approaches.

DC voters elect officials who support police accountability, bail reform, and alternative approaches to public safety—but Congress blocks every reform while DC residents have no voting representation to defend these policies. No state would tolerate federal politicians overriding 16 years of criminal justice work or forcing the state to abandon evidence-based policing reforms. We need statehood now."

## Persuadable

### One-Liner
"Congress overrode 16 years of DC criminal justice work in 2023 and now blocks police accountability measures used in 20 states—while DC has zero voting representation to defend local public safety decisions."

### Elevator Pitch
"In 2023, Congress overturned DC's revised criminal code—16 years of work by local judges, prosecutors, and community stakeholders—using a disapproval resolution. Now Congress is blocking DC's police accountability policies (body cameras, mental health consultations before use of force) while 20 states have similar laws. Congress is also forcing DC to reinstate cash bail while Illinois, New Jersey, and New York have eliminated or limited cash bail without federal interference. Apply the conservative principle consistently: if your state's criminal justice reforms are decided locally, DC's should be too."

### Full Argument
"Local communities should control their own criminal justice and public safety policies. In 2023, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to overturn DC's [Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/26)—a comprehensive modernization that took 16 years to develop and involved local judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and community advocates. The DC Council passed it unanimously. Congress rejected all that local expertise and community input with a single vote.

Apply the conservative principle consistently: [20 states mandate body cameras for law enforcement](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/body-camera-laws-by-state), including Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Carolina. Georgia passed legislation requiring retention of body camera footage for specific periods. Yet H.R. 5107 would repeal DC's police accountability law that includes similar body camera policies and requirements for mental health consultation before use of deadly force. If Georgia can establish body camera policies, why can't DC?

On bail reform: [Illinois eliminated cash bail entirely](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/no-cash-bail-states) through the Pretrial Fairness Act in September 2023. New Jersey virtually eliminated cash bail in 2017. [New York ended cash bail](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/facts-bail-reform-new-york-how-pretrial-detention-and-release-works-now) for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies in 2020—and research shows it [reduced recidivism and felony rearrests](https://www.fwd.us/news/new-york-bail-reform-success-story/). Congress doesn't try to override any of these state policies. Yet H.R. 5214 forces DC to reinstate cash bail, eliminating DC's pretrial justice reforms.

Here's the context that should concern anyone who values federalism: DC has [the highest incarceration rate in America](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/DC.html)—816 per 100,000 people, exceeding every state. Local officials, prosecutors, and judges concluded that criminal justice reform was necessary to address this crisis. Congress overrode 16 years of their work without considering the local context or expertise.

This isn't about red or blue politics—it's about whether local communities can make evidence-based criminal justice decisions with input from local law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and residents. The same federalism principle that protects your state's criminal justice reforms should apply to DC. Congress shouldn't be micromanaging local police policies and bail procedures—especially when DC residents have zero voting representation in that same Congress."

## Hypocrisy Examples

### Example 1: Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA)
**Point:** Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) sponsors H.R. 5107 to repeal DC's police accountability law—yet his home state of Georgia mandates body camera footage retention and has pending legislation requiring all officers to wear body cameras.

**Details:** Clyde sponsors the [CLEAN DC Act (H.R. 5107)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/5107) to repeal DC's Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act, which includes body camera policies and use-of-force restrictions. Yet [Georgia law requires](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/title-50/chapter-18/article-5/section-50-18-96/) all law enforcement departments that use body-worn cameras to retain video recordings for 180 days, with extended retention for videos involving arrests or use of force. Georgia's proposed [Transparency in Policing Act (HB325)](https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1565487) would require all uniformed officers to wear body cameras by July 1, 2025. While Georgia establishes police accountability measures, Clyde blocks DC from doing the same.

### Example 2: Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY)
**Point:** Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) sponsors H.R. 5214 to force DC to reinstate cash bail—yet her home state of New York eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies in 2020, a policy that research shows reduced recidivism.

**Details:** Stefanik sponsors the [District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act (H.R. 5214)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/5214) to require DC to impose cash bail on those charged with public safety offenses. Yet [New York ended cash bail](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/facts-bail-reform-new-york-how-pretrial-detention-and-release-works-now) for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies in 2020—exactly the type of reform DC was pursuing. Research from John Jay College found New York's bail reform [led to decreased felony rearrests and reduced recidivism](https://www.fwd.us/news/new-york-bail-reform-success-story/). New York Governor Kathy Hochul has defended the state's bail reform against federal interference. Yet Stefanik—who represents a New York district—seeks to force DC to abandon similar reforms while DC residents have no voting representation to defend their local policies.

### Example 3: Senate Democrats from bail reform states
**Point:** 33 Senate Democrats voted to overturn DC's revised criminal code in 2023—including senators from Illinois, New Jersey, and Connecticut, states that have eliminated or severely limited cash bail without federal interference.

**Details:** The Senate voted [81-14 to pass H.J.Res. 26](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2023/s49) overturning DC's Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022. Only 14 senators voted against the measure. Senators from states with progressive criminal justice reforms voted to block DC's reforms: Illinois (which [eliminated cash bail entirely in 2023](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/no-cash-bail-states)), New Jersey (which virtually eliminated cash bail in 2017), and Connecticut (which [mandates body cameras statewide](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/body-camera-laws-by-state)). These senators defend their states' right to criminal justice reform while denying DC the same autonomy—despite DC having the highest incarceration rate in the nation and DC residents having zero voting representation in the Senate.
