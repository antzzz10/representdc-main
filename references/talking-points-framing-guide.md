# Talking Points Framing Guide

**Internal Reference Document for Statehood Organization Leaders**

This guide outlines the key differences in how to frame DC autonomy issues for two distinct audiences: allies (those who already support DC autonomy) and persuadables (those who may oppose progressive issues but could be swayed with the right framing).

---

## For Allies (DC Autonomy Supporters)

### Tone & Framing Principles:

- ✅ **Direct about power dynamics** - "Congress micromanages DC while no state faces this"
- ✅ **Name the opposition** - "House Republicans blocked..." (be specific about who is doing this)
- ✅ **Justice framing** - Use language like "taxation without representation," "democratic rights," "fundamental fairness"
- ✅ **Solidarity language** - "We need to fight back," "join us," "our fight"
- ✅ **Connect to movements** - Link DC autonomy to voting rights, racial justice, progressive values, civil rights history
- ✅ **Emotional appeals** - "This is fundamentally unfair," "it's wrong that..."
- ✅ **Call to action** - "Tell your senator to support DC statehood," "contact your representative"

### Example Framing for Allies:

> "House Republicans are literally micromanaging DC's traffic lights while 700,000 residents have no voting representation in Congress. This is Jim Crow-era control dressed up as oversight—Congress treating DC like a colony while we pay more federal taxes per capita than any state. No state would tolerate this interference."

**Key Elements:**
- Names the specific party ("House Republicans")
- Uses strong historical comparison ("Jim Crow-era control")
- Emotional language ("literally micromanaging," "treating DC like a colony")
- Justice framing ("no voting representation," "no state would tolerate")

## For Persuadables (Conservative-Leaning, Libertarians, Small-Government Advocates)

### Tone & Framing Principles:

- ✅ **Non-partisan** - Say "Congress blocks..." NOT "Republicans block..." (avoid partisan language)
- ✅ **Conservative principles** - Emphasize local control, federalism, limited government, states' rights
- ✅ **Data over emotion** - "Studies show 30% reduction..." Use statistics and evidence
- ✅ **Pragmatic** - "This is common sense, not ideology," "evidence-based policy"
- ✅ **Hypocrisy angle** - "If a Texas town wanted cameras, Washington shouldn't interfere"
- ✅ **Fiscal responsibility** - "DC taxpayers fund this, not federal dollars," "zero cost to federal budget"
- ✅ **States' rights parallel** - "Apply the same principle you'd want for your state"
- ✅ **Avoid culture war framing** - Don't connect to progressive movements

### Example Framing for Persuadables:

> "Evidence-based traffic enforcement (cameras near schools reduce fatal crashes 30%) is used in conservative and liberal communities nationwide. Yet federal politicians are micromanaging DC's local traffic policy—funded entirely by DC taxpayers, zero federal dollars involved. If your town council voted for speed cameras to protect kids, should Washington override that decision? This is federal overreach, pure and simple."

**Key Elements:**
- Neutral language ("federal politicians" not "Republicans")
- Data-driven ("30% reduction," "evidence-based")
- Appeals to conservative principles ("federal overreach," "local control")
- Fiscal framing ("zero federal dollars")
- Makes it relatable ("If your town council voted...")
- Uses conservative vocabulary ("overreach," "micromanaging")

## Key Differences Summary Table

| **For Allies** | **For Persuadables** |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "House Republicans" | "Congress" or "federal politicians" |
| "Taxation without representation" | "Local taxpayers should control local budgets" |
| "Jim Crow-era control" | "Federal overreach" |
| "Democratic rights" | "Federalism principles" |
| "We need to fight back" | "This violates conservative principles" |
| Emotional justice framing | Data-driven pragmatic framing |
| Link to progressive movements | Link to states' rights, limited government |
| "No state would tolerate this" | "Apply the same standard you'd want for your state" |
| Name specific opponents | Use neutral language about institutions |
| Call to solidarity and action | Appeal to ideological consistency |
| Connect to civil rights history | Connect to founding principles of federalism |
| "This is fundamentally wrong" | "This is inconsistent with conservative values" |

## Additional Strategic Notes

### When to Use Each Approach:

**Allies Framework:**
- DC residents and advocates
- Progressive activists nationwide
- Democratic elected officials
- Voting rights organizations
- Civil rights groups
- Social media posts in progressive spaces

**Persuadables Framework:**
- Moderate Republicans
- Libertarians
- Small-government conservatives
- Fiscal conservatives
- Independent voters
- Suburban/rural audiences
- Conservative media appearances
- Bipartisan legislative pitches

### Messaging Discipline:

**For Persuadables, AVOID:**
- Partisan attacks or naming specific politicians
- Culture war language or hot-button social issues
- References to progressive movements or causes
- Emotional or justice-based appeals
- "Us vs. them" framing

**For Persuadables, EMPHASIZE:**
- Principles they claim to value (local control, limited government)
- Data and evidence
- Fiscal arguments (no federal money involved)
- Hypocrisy of their position
- Making them uncomfortable with cognitive dissonance

### Testing and Refinement:

Monitor which messages perform best with each audience using:
- Social media engagement metrics (via Plausible)
- A/B testing in email campaigns
- Feedback from coalition partners
- Poll testing if resources allow

Refine messaging based on what resonates, but maintain the core distinction between emotional/justice appeals for allies and principled/pragmatic appeals for persuadables.

## Hypocrisy Research Examples

### Traffic Safety (Completed December 2025)

**Primary Sponsor:** Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA-10)
- **District:** Pennsylvania's 10th (Harrisburg, York, Dauphin County)
- **Bills Introduced:**
  - H.R. 5525 (Stop DC CAMERA Act)
  - H.R. 5242 amendments (Traffic Camera Repeal, Right Turn Prohibition Repeal)

**Hypocrisy Points:**

1. **His State Uses the Very Thing He Blocks DC From Using**
   - Pennsylvania law permits municipalities to use red light cameras
   - Philadelphia operates 34 camera intersections with 71 more planned
   - Multiple PA suburbs use cameras: Pittsburgh, Abington Township, Montgomery Township, Bensalem Township, Warrington Township
   - Perry blocks DC from using cameras while his own state allows and expands them

2. **His State's Safety Record is Getting Worse**
   - Pennsylvania saw pedestrian deaths INCREASE in 2023 (192 deaths, up from 184 in 2022)
   - PA was one of only 21 states where pedestrian deaths rose (most saw decreases)
   - Yet Perry prevents DC from using proven safety tools that could help

- [PhotoEnforced: Pennsylvania Red Light Camera Locations](https://www.photoenforced.com/pennsylvania.html)

**How to Use This Research:**

*For Allies:* "Rep. Scott Perry blocks DC's traffic cameras while his own state of Pennsylvania allows them—Philadelphia has 34 camera intersections with 71 more planned. This is pure hypocrisy: local control for thee but not for DC."

*For Persuadables:* "Rep. Perry introduced three bills blocking DC's traffic cameras. Yet Pennsylvania law permits red light cameras, and multiple Pennsylvania cities use them—including Philadelphia with 34 intersections. If automated enforcement is good enough for Pennsylvania communities, why can't DC make the same local decision?"
